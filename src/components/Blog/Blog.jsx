            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based
            mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain,
            scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should
            permit loading resources.

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center">
            Firebase is used to authenticate users in apps like Airbnb and
            Pinterest. Realtime Database. The Firebase Realtime Database is used
            to store and sync data in real time in apps like Uber and Snapchat.
            Cloud Messaging. Firebase is a popular mobile and web application
            development platform that offers a range of services, including
            authentication. Some reasons developers choose Firebase for
            authentication include: Ease of Use: Firebase provides a simple and
            easy-to-use authentication system, making it convenient for
            developers to implement secure user authentication without extensive
            backend development. Scalability: Firebase scales effortlessly,
            making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale
            applications. Real-time Database Integration: Firebase's
            authentication seamlessly integrates with its real-time database,
            making it easy to manage user data. Social Media Authentication:
            Firebase supports authentication through popular social media
            platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others, making it
            convenient for users to sign in with their existing accounts.
            Security Features: Firebase authentication provides secure
            token-based authentication, reducing the risk of common security
            vulnerabilities. Alternatives to Firebase for authentication
            include: Custom Backend Solutions: You can implement your own
            authentication system using server-side technologies like Node.js,
            Django, Flask, or other frameworks. OAuth/OpenID Connect:
            Implementing OAuth or OpenID Connect allows you to use third-party
            identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, or GitHub, for user
            authentication. Amazon Cognito: Similar to Firebase, Amazon Cognito
            is a fully managed authentication service by AWS, providing features
            like user pools and identity pools. Auth0: Auth0 is a third-party
            identity management platform that handles authentication,
            authorization, and user management, offering features like social
            media login, multi-factor authentication, and more.

            What is Node? How does Node work?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center">
            Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly
            in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can,
            therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to
            the operating system, file system, and everything else required to
            build fully-functional applications. Node.js is written in C, C++,
            and JavaScript, and it is built on the open-source V8 JavaScript
            engine which also powers JS in browsers such as Google Chrome. As V8
            supports new features in JavaScript, they are incorporated into
            Node.

            How does the private route work?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center">
            A private route is a mechanism commonly used in web development to
            restrict access to certain pages or content based on whether a user
            is authenticated or authorized to view that content. It's often
            employed in conjunction with user authentication systems. Here's a
            general overview of how private routes typically work: User
            Authentication: When a user logs in, they are typically issued an
            authentication token or session identifier. This token serves as
            proof of their identity. Route Configuration: Each route in the web
            application is configured with information about whether it is a
            public route (accessible without authentication) or a private route
            (requires authentication). Route Guarding: Before allowing access to
            a private route, the application checks the user's authentication
            status by verifying the presence and validity of their
            authentication token. Redirect or Access: If the user is
            authenticated, they are allowed to access the private route, and the
            corresponding content is displayed. If the user is not
            authenticated, they are typically redirected to a login page or
            another designated page, signaling that authentication is required.
            Middleware or Hooks: In many web frameworks or libraries, middleware
            functions or hooks are used to implement this check before rendering
            the components associated with a specific route.
